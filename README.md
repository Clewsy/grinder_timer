This is a programmable timer tethered to a Rancilio Rocky coffee grinder. The Rocky is a "dumb" grinder and electrically very simple. Basically it's an ac motor with an on/off switch and a momentary push-button to grind. This project adds an electronic timer so that repeatable grind quantities can be produced without having to stand over the grinder. Features: 
- Four programmable presets (A, B, C or D). 
- Left/Right buttons to select preset. 
- Up/Down buttons to adjust grind duration for selected preset (0.25s increments up to 60s). 
- Grind button to initiate grind and begin countdown timer. 
- Oled display (128x64) to show preset menu and countdown timer. 
- Aluminium enclosure. 
- Single cable (3-core) tether to grinder for power and control.

The code , schematic and PCB layout are all included here on github.
